### FAQ
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.『Can you lock the screen of the phone during workouts or while running?』

A. No, you can not lock the screen of the phone during workouts and running routes as it doesn't use background location tracking for running and background listeners for smart watch application, the mobile application uses KeepAwake for this and keeps your screen unlocked while you are working out. However, if you don't connect your smart watch to your phone application or lock your smart watch, the phone application will still be working.
